This tool is designed to efficiently scan and identify open ports on remote systems. In addition to basic port scanning, it performs reverse DNS lookups and service detection to reveal the services running on discovered ports. It supports multi-threading for faster execution and provides detailed reports, making it an essential tool for network administrators and penetration testers to assess network vulnerabilities.
